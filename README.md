# QuineMcCluskey-Level1
Minimization method of Boolean Functions for Digital Circuits.

The following program is a code implementation of the QuineMcCluskey method, but only covering the Level 1.

The program uses an input file with the following caracteristics:

     4 //Variables amount
     9 //Minterms amount
     5 //Dontcares amount
     0
     14
     2
     8
     4
     5
     7
     3
     9
     10
     11
     12
     13
     1

As output, the program displays the minimized implicants of the function and generate a file with the same information, this file can be located in the same path of the project.
